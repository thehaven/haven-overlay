This is the personal gentoo layman repository.

Many of the ebuilds in here are copied/borrowed/edited versions of those
found in other layman repositories. They are kept upto date for my own
use and generally reflect areas of interest that I am currently working
on or where I needed a version bump that was not yet in the mainstream
repo's.

Hopefully you find something of use in here.
