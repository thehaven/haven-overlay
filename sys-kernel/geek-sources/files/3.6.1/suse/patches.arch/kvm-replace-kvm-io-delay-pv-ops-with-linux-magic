Subject: Replace kvm io delay pv-ops with linux magic
References: bnc#556135, FATE#306453
Patch-Mainline: Submitted to virtualization list

Currently we use pv-ops to tell linux not to do anything on io_delay.

While the basic idea is good IMHO, I don't see why we would need pv-ops
for that. The io delay function already has a switch that can do nothing
if you're so inclined.

So here's a patch (stacked on top of the previous pv-ops series) that
removes the io delay pv-ops hook and just sets the native io delay
variable instead.
