Subject: brcmsmac: document firmware dependencies
References: bnc#733148
Patch-mainline: Submitted to linux-wireless 25 Jul 2012

 The brcmsmac driver requests firmware but doesn't document the
 dependency. This means that software that analyzes the modules to
 determine if firmware is needed won't detect it.

 Specifically, (at least) openSUSE won't install the kernel-firmware
 package if no hardware requires it.

 This patch adds the MODULE_FIRMWARE directives.
